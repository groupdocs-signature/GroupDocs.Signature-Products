    title: "About GroupDocs.Signature for Java API"
    content: |
        [GroupDocs.Signature for Java](/signature/java/) is an advanced Java eSignature library to digitally sign documents using various signature signature types such as text, image, barcode, stamp, form-field, QR-code and metadata. By adding just a few lines of code, empower your Java applications with features to view, add, edit, validate, delete and search digital signatures within PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel worksheets, PowerPoint presentations, Adobe Photoshop, metafiles and image file formats. The e-signature API also supports additional features to customize signature properties as per requirements.

    content_left: |
        Below Java code example clearly demonstrates the steps to **delete text signatures from TSV file in Java** by adding just a few lines of code.

        *   Create new instance of **Signature** class and pass source document path as a constructor parameter.
        *   Instantiate **TextSearchOptions** object with desired properties.
        *   Call **search** method to obtain list of **TextSignatures**.
        *   Select the **TextSignature** object(s) that should be removed from the document.
        *   Call **Signature** object **delete** method, pass one or several signatures to it.
        *   Analyze **DeleteResult** results to confirm signatures were updated or not.

          title: "What is TSV File Format"
          content: |
            A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.
