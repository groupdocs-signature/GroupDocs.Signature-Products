      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) empowers .NET developers to safeguard DOCX documents against alterations using digital signatures. Augment your business applications with robust data protection capabilities.
      
      1. Pass the DOCX document to the Signature class constructor.
      2. Utilize a digital certificate and its password to secure the document.
      3. Optionally, add a visual representation of the digital signature on the document pages.
      4. Sign the document to ensure it remains unaltered.
