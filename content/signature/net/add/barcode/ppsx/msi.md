    content_left: |
        [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) makes it easy for .NET developers to add Msi barcodes to PPSX files within their applications by implementing a few easy steps.

        *   Create new instance of Signature class and pass source PPSX document path as a constructor parameter.
        *   Instantiate the BarcodeSignOptions object with required text and set EncodeType property to MSI.
        *   Call Sign method of Signature class and pass output PPSX file name with BarcodeSignOptions to it.
        *   Analyze SignResult result to check newly created signatures if needed.

          content: |
            MSI Plessey (also known as Modified Plessey) is a numeric-only, variable-length symbology that is a variant of Plessey Code, which was originally developed by the Plessey Company of England in 1971. MSI Plessey has typically been used for inventory tracking, such as on the front edge of shelves in supermarkets and other warehouse environments to indicate where products are stored. It has also been used to identify storage containers.
