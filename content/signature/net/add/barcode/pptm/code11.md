    content_left: |
        [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) makes it easy for .NET developers to add Code11 barcodes to PPTM files within their applications by implementing a few easy steps.

        *   Create new instance of Signature class and pass source PPTM document path as a constructor parameter.
        *   Instantiate the BarcodeSignOptions object with required text and set EncodeType property to Code11.
        *   Call Sign method of Signature class and pass output PPTM file name with BarcodeSignOptions to it.
        *   Analyze SignResult result to check newly created signatures if needed.

          title: "About Code11 Barcode"
          content: |
            Code 11 is a barcode symbology developed by Intermec in 1977. It is used primarily in telecommunications. The symbol can encode any length string consisting of the digits 0ï¿½9 and the dash character (-). A twelfth code represents the start/stop character, commonly printed as '*'. One or two modulo-11 check digit(s) can be included.
