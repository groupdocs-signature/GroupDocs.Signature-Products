    title_left: "How to Generate Rm4scc Barcode for ODT file in C#"
    content_left: |
        [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) makes it easy for .NET developers to add Rm4scc barcodes to ODT files within their applications by implementing a few easy steps.

        *   Create new instance of Signature class and pass source ODT document path as a constructor parameter.
        *   Instantiate the BarcodeSignOptions object with required text and set EncodeType property to RM4SCC.
        *   Call Sign method of Signature class and pass output ODT file name with BarcodeSignOptions to it.
        *   Analyze SignResult result to check newly created signatures if needed.
