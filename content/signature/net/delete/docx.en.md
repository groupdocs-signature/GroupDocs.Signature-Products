    content: |
      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) simplifies the task for .NET developers to remove text signatures in DOCX files by implementing a few straightforward steps.
      
      1. Provide the path of the DOCX file to an instance of the Signature class.
      2. Invoke the Search method to retrieve all text signatures within the document.
      3. Delete one or more of the retrieved text signatures.
      4. Examine the results of the document processing.
