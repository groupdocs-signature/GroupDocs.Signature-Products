    content: |
      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) can authenticate the presence of specific signatures within a PDF document. .NET developers can effortlessly enhance their applications by incorporating features provided by our solution.
      
      1. Load the PDF file into the Signature instance.
      2. Instantiate and configure TextVerifyOptions to achieve the desired verification outcome.
      3. Commence the verification process.
      4. Review and interpret the verification results.
