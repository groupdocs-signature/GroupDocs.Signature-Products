      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) can authenticate the presence of specific signatures within a PPTX document. .NET developers can effortlessly enhance their applications by incorporating features provided by our solution.
      
      1. Load the PPTX file into the Signature instance.
      2. Instantiate and configure VerifyOptions to achieve the desired verification outcome.
      3. Commence the verification process.
      4. Review and interpret the verification results.
