      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) empowers .NET developers to revise the content of text signatures previously embedded in PDF files. Augment .NET applications with advanced capabilities.
      
      1. Import the PDF file into the Signature instance.
      2. Extract a list of all text signatures within the document.
      3. Revise the content of any identified signature.
      4. Evaluate the results of the modification.
