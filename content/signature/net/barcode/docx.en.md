      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) facilitates the generation of barcodes in numerous popular formats and their placement on DOCX pages. Supporting over 60 barcode types, .NET applications can be effortlessly augmented with barcode signing functionalities by integrating our library.
      
      1. Supply the DOCX file or stream for processing.
      2. Pass the barcode text to the BarcodeSignOptions instance.
      3. Tailor barcode options such as position, size, etc.
      4. Persist the file with the newly appended barcode.
