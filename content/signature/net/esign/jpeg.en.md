      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) facilitates the incorporation of customized text signatures into JPEG files. .NET developers can seamlessly integrate signing functionality into their applications using our software.
      
      1. Provide the JPEG file to the Signature instance for signing.
      2. Utilize TextSignOptions to specify the signature parameters.
      3. Configure attributes such as size, color, and content.
      4. Save the signed file to the desired destination.
