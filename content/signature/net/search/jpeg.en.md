      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/net/) offers a robust engine for locating digital signatures within JPEG files. .NET developers can effortlessly enhance their applications with our solution.
      
      1. Supply the JPEG file path for the signature search.
      2. Employ TextSearchOptions to refine the search criteria.
      3. Invoke the Search method to retrieve the results.
      4. Assess the list of identified signatures.
