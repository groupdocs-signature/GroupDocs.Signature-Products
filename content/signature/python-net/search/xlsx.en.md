    title: "How to search for signatures in XLSX using Python"
    content: |
      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/python-net/) provides a powerful engine for detecting digital signatures in XLSX files. Python via .NET developers can easily enhance their apps with this functionality.
      
      1. Provide the XLSX file path for the signature search.
      2. Use SearchOptions to refine the search criteria.
      3. Call the Search method to retrieve the results.
      4. Review the list of identified signatures.
