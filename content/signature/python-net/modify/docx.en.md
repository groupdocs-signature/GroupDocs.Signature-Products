    title: "How to edit signatures in DOCX using Python"
    content: |
      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/python-net/) allows Python via .NET developers to edit text signatures already embedded in DOCX files. Enhance your Python via .NET applications with advanced functionality.
      
      1. Load the DOCX document into the Signature instance.
      2. Retrieve a list of all signatures in the document.
      3. Edit the content of any identified signature.
      4. Verify the signature modification results.
