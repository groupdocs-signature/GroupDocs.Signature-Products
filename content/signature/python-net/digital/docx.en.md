    content: |
      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/python-net/) helps Python via .NET developers secure DOCX files by adding digital signatures. Strengthen your business applications with robust document protection features.
      
      1. Load the DOCX file into the Signature class.
      2. Apply a digital certificate and its password to secure the file.
      3. Optionally, add a visual display of the digital signature on the document pages.
      4. Sign the document to prevent unauthorized changes.
