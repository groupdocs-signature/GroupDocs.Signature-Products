    title: "How to verify PDF signatures using Python"
    content: |
      [GroupDocs.Signature](/signature/python-net/) verifies specific signatures in PDF documents. Python via .NET developers can enhance their apps by integrating this verification feature.
      
      1. Load the PDF file into the Signature instance.
      2. Create and configure VerifyOptions to match the desired verification criteria.
      3. Start the verification process.
      4. Interpret the results from the verification process.
